# Advent of Code 2016

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016).  I did some of the exercises in Swift, some in Python, some in Objective-C.

I've been using [CodeRunner](https://coderunnerapp.com/) to code, run, and debug these programs.  If you don't have CodeRunner you can run them from the command line:

```bash
# Swift
swift 2.swift
```

```bash
# Python
python 2.py
```

```bash
# Objective-C
xcrun clang -fobjc-arc -framework Foundation -ObjC -o 2.out 2.m
2.out
```

For each day I download the input into a text file called input.txt.  Each program has some boilerplate code that reads that file.

**NOTE TO SELF:** Don't accidentally add trailing empty lines to the input.txt files.

Links for each day look like this:

- Problem description: <http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1>.
- Input data: <http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1/input>.
