# Advent of Code 2016

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016).

For each day I downloaded the input into a text file called input.txt.

**NOTE TO SELF:** Remember not to accidentally add trailing empty lines to the input.txt files.

Links for each day look like this:

- Problem description: <http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1>
- Input data: <http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1/input>
