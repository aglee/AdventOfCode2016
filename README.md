# Advent of Code 2016

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016).  I did some of the exercises in Swift, some in Python.  I'm still early on the learning curve for both those languages, so the code is rough.  I've been using [CodeRunner](https://coderunnerapp.com/) to code, run, and debug these programs.

For each day I downloaded the input into a text file called input.txt.  I have some boilerplate code that reads the input.txt file that I paste into the code for each program.

**NOTE TO SELF:** Don't accidentally add trailing empty lines to the input.txt files.

Links for each day look like this:
